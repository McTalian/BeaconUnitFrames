# BeaconUnitFrames

_A light in the darkness of Midnight. Custom Unit Frames with comprehensive configuration options._

## Goal

BeaconUnitFrames (or BUF) aims to allow you to "skin" and modify all of your unit frames within the increased addon restrictions of the Midnight expansion.

## Getting Started

Once you've installed the addon, use `/buf` to open the options menu. There you will find a guided tour to walk you through the available options.

## Supported Frames

- Player Frame
- Target Frame
- Pet Frame
- Focus Frame
- Target of Target
- Target of Focus
- Party Frames
- Boss Frames

### Coming Soon

- Raid Frames

## Translations and Internationalization (i18n)

This project is set up to fully support translations into all WoW-supported locales. Missing translations will be available for each locale in the issues page (link below). I'm choosing not to use Curse's platform because it's quite cumbersome for both sides. I am looking into easier ways to manage this, but this is what has worked for my prior projects.

## Bugs and Feature Requests

Please submit bugs and feature requests on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/McTalian/BeaconUnitFrames/issues). I want to support as many options as possible with this addon.

If you want to get involved, Pull Requests are welcome as well!
